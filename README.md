# shift-share
Replication package and code for "Quasi-Experimental Shift-Share Designs"
(Borusyak, Hull, and Jaravel 2018, https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01221)

This project includes:
- the replication archive with all code and data necessary to replicate the results reported in the paper (described in detail in Readme.doc)
- the "ssaggregate" Stata package which helps researchers implement shift-share designs (also available by typing ssc install ssaggregate)

We appreciate all comments on the paper and code!
